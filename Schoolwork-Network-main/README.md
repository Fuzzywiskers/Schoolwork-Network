# Schoolwork-Network #
In this project I hope we can work together to create a platform where students can come together and focus on communicating about their school work and classes.
If you do not know how to code you can help with telling the coders how things should look and what could make it better.
While it might take a while to create, and experiment with, I believe as a group we can complete this project and even stay connected with it during and after High School.

Currently our coders are Camden Martin and Malia Moreno.

Our testers and others joining this progect will be Veronica Scott, Bibiennegrace Lopez, and Emma Lee.

I also want to give the credit of this idea to Emma Lee.
